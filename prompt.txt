I'm doing a project on information visualization using jupyter notebook. I have a dataset on bus route utilization that includes the following data: 
1	route	"Friendly" route code that joins with PAAC geospatial data.
2	ridership_route_code	Route code for joining with ridership data.
3	route_full_name	Full route name as it would appear on the headsign of the bus/light rail vehicle.
4	current_garage	The garage that the bus route operates out of. Route 64 alternates between East Liberty and West Mif…
5	mode	Transit mode: bus, light rail (the T), or incline.
6	month_start	The first day of the month in YYYY-MM-DD format.
7	year_month	The year-month key in YYYYMM format.
8	day_type	Weekday, Saturday, or Sunday/Holiday service. PAAC routes and schedules vary based on the service da…
9	avg_riders	The average daily riders for that month, day type, and route.
10	day_count	The number of days for each day_type in the month. Certain holidays are considered Sundays. Riders 

I have the data imported into jupyter notebook and a pandas dataframe as such: 
data = pd.read_csv('12bb84ed-397e-435c-8d1b-8ce543108698.csv')

Can you make a circular bar plot for each individual month from 2017 to current, 
where the length of the bar is the number of riders that month, 
and each bar is also divided into individual routes?
I have attached an example of what it should look like, where the inner labels A, B, C etc should be the month and year Jan 2017, Feb 2017, etc until the present day.
The length of each bar should be the total ridership that month, and each bar should be divided into routes each designated by a different color, which is included in the legend.
